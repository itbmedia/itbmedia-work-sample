# Work sample guide

This is a guide for a work sample that we at ITB Media use to gage your coding.

We believe it's important to be familiar with both front-end and back-end therefore this repository contains a guide for both sides of this sample project.

## Expectations

At ITB media we work mainly using the Symfony PHP framework for back-end and React JS for front-end and MYSQL for database.

However you are welcome to create the work sample using any framework you are comfortable with.

## Resources

* [design/index.png (template preview)](design/index.png)
* [index template @ figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Z6bFqpeDHmklkKlb9Fizuc/Arbetsprov?node-id=13%3A1)
* [data/dump.sql](data/dump.sql)

## Back-end

The sample database contains sample categoriea and products.

You need to create endpoints for the following actions

* List all products (with pagination and search)
* Create a new product
* Get a single product
* Update a single product
* Deleting a single product

## Front-end

Create a page that displays all the products as shown in the design and the following interactions

* Pagination (10 products per page)
* Search products by title, sku or category
* Every column needs to be sortable

## If you have the time

Create a view for managing the products (creating, editing and removing)

## Submission

We expect you to leave your work sample in a public git repository on your account, send the link to our e-mail 

## What we will look at

We are not looking for a pixel perfect replica of the template, we just want to get understand how you code and your approach
